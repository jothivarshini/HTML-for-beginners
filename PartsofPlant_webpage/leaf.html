<h1>Leaf</h1>

<img src="leaf.jpg" alt="leaf">

<p>A leaf (plural leaves) is the principal lateral appendage of the vascular plant stem, 
    usually borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis. The leaves, stem, flower and fruit together form the shoot system.
     Leaves are collectively referred to as foliage, as in "autumn foliage". In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue,
      the palisade mesophyll, is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf but in some species, including the mature foliage
       of Eucalyptus, palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral. Most leaves are flattened 
       and have distinct upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces that differ in color, hairiness, the number of stomata 
       (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of epicuticular wax and other features.
        Leaves are mostly green in color due to the presence of a compound called chlorophyll that is essential for 
    photosynthesis as it absorbs light energy from the sun. A leaf with lighter-colored or white patches or edges is called a variegated leaf.</p>
